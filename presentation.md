- Introduces ways to break problems apart
- Provides tools to perform "If this, then that" analysis
- Provides a context for understanding logical systems

- I have other rants about how we should be teaching logic, number theory, and set theory instead of algebra, trigonometry, and calculus.

# [fit] Proof by Contradiction

---

# Start with the opposite of the statement you wish to prove

---

# [fit] Use only existing premises

<br>

# [fit] _axioms, other proofs_

---

[.build-lists: true]

# Contradiction

- If you reach an `impossible state`

- then the opposite statement is `false`

- and thus the statement is `true`.

---

# [fit] Example

---

# [fit] $$\sqrt{2}$$ is irrational

---

[.build-lists: true]

# Definition

- Rational numbers can be written in form $$\frac{a}{b}$$

- $$a$$ and $$b$$ are whole numbers that share no prime factors.

- Irrational numbers cannot

---

[.build-lists: true]

# Givens

<br>

- Any number written in the form $$2n$$ must be even

- If $$n^2$$ is even then $$n$$ must be even

- If $$n^2$$ is even then $$n^2$$ must be a multiple of $$4$$

---

[.build-lists: true]

## [fit] Rational numbers can be written in form $$\frac{a}{b}$$

- $$a$$ and $$b$$ are whole numbers that share no prime factors.
- One or both $$a$$ or $$b$$ must be odd
- Both $$a$$ and $$b$$ cannot be even

---

# [fit] Proof by Contradiction

- Assume there is a rational number $$\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{2}$$

---

[.build-lists: true]

# [fit] Deduce information about $$a$$

- If $$\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{2}$$ then
- $$\frac{a^2}{b^2} = 2$$
- $$a^2 = 2b^2$$
- _(given)_ Thus $$a^2$$ must be even
- _(given)_ Thus $$a$$ is even

---

[.build-lists: true]

# [fit] Deduce information about $$b$$

- $$a^2 = 2b^2$$ and $$a$$ is even
- _(given)_ Thus $$a^2$$ is a multiple of four and can be written as $$4n$$ where $$n$$ is odd
- $$4n$$ = $$2b^2$$
- $$2n$$ = $$b^2$$
- _(given)_ thus $$b^2$$ is even ‚Äî and _(given)_ thus $$b$$ is even

---

# [fit] **CONTRADICTION** :bomb: :boom:

<br>

# [fit] both $$a$$ and $$b$$ cannot be even

---

[.build-lists: true]

- Started with assumption there could be a rational number

- Arrived at contradiction

- Thus there is no rational number $$\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt{2}$$

---

# [fit] Induction

---

[.build-lists: true]

- Some statement $$P$$ is true over some set of numbers (typically the non-negative integers or positive integers)
- Show that it is true for smallest number in set (typically $$0$$ or $$1$$)
- Assume is true for $$n$$
- Prove that if true for $$n$$ then true for $$n+1$$

Sum of the first N positive integers

$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + (n-1) + n$$ = $$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

Show for $$1$$

$$1 = \frac{1(2)}{2} = 1$$

---

Assume true for $$k$$

$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + (k-1) + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$$

Prove true for $$k+1$$

---

Prove

$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + (k-1) + k + (k+1) =  \frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2}$$
